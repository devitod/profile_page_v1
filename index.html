        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring web designer who is hoping to build up the world around me and affect positive change. I am a former English teacher, public relations specialst and radio station manager. I'm hoping to create websites that hold true to the values that I've fostered throughout my various careers.</p>
        <p>There is a quote from the Dalai Lama that goes "Let's take care of others wholeheartedly, of both our friends and our enemies. This is the basis for true compassion." I try to live my life by this principle; you get what you give.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to continue to learn and improve. One of the most fascinating aspects of programming to me is that there is always something new to learn. As an educator, and a lifelong learner, the idea of always pushing myself to learn new things is beyond exciting.</p>
